# Quote match game -udemy

Created as part of Udemy's "The Modern Python3 Bootcamp" course

When run, the program will gather data on various famous quotes from the website http://quotes.toscrape.com. It will then select a random quote, and prompt the user to enter the name of the individual who the quote is attributed to. On incorrect guesses, the player is provided with a hint until they run out of chances. Once the player is out of chances or correctly guesses the name, the game will prompt the player if they wish to replay. If the player chooses to play again, the game restarts from the top(without scraping the website again).
